def pack64(vector):
    '''
    Packs a NumPy vector into a kind-of-floating-point, kind-of-base64
    representation, requiring only 3 bytes per vector entry.
    
    This is meant for transmitting vector data over the Internet, in a
    situation where:
    
    * Arbitrary bytes can't be transmitted
    * We need to send the vector in as few bytes as possible
    * Simply base64-encoding floating-point data -- at 5.33 bytes
      per entry -- isn't small enough
    
    Possible applications include rapidly updating a vector using STOMP, or
    encoding a vector in a URL.

    The function returns a string *b* of bytes, representing digits using the
    URL-safe base64 character set (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, _), as follows:

    * b[0] contains the power-of-two exponent, biased by 40. That is:

        - An exponent of 0 ("A") means to multiply all the integers that
          follow by 2^-40.
        - An exponent of 30 ("e") means to divide the integers by 1024.
        - An exponent of 40 ("o") means to leave the integers as is.
        - An exponent of 63 ("_") means to multiply the integers by
          2^23.

    * b[1:4], b[4:7], etc. contain the values in the vector, as 18-bit,
      big-endian, ones-complement integers.
      
    The last value will be found in b[3*K-2 : 3*K+1], so the length of the
    string overall will be 3*K + 1.

    This encoding can represent positive, negative, or zero values, with
    magnitudes from 2^-40 to approximately 2^40, as long as the other
    values in the vector are comparable in magnitude.
    
    If your vector math blew up and gave you infinity or NaN somewhere, this
    function returns a 0-dimensional vector, but uses the exponent as a flag.
    It doesn't try to represent the other values in the vector, because
    they're useless.

        - 'A' is an actual zero-dimensional vector.
        - '_' is an infinite vector.
        - '-' is a vector with a magnitude of 2^40 or greater in it.
          Might as well be infinite, because this function can't represent it.
        - 'n' is a vector containing NaN. You probably tried to
          normalize a zero vector.

    If you would rather just crash in these last three cases, use
    `pack64_check` instead.

    **Precision**: Each entry of the vector can distinguish 2^18
    different values, giving you about 5 significant digits of accuracy.
    Of course, they all have to choose from the _same_ 2^18 fixed-point values.
